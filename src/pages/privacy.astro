    <p>
      “Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers we transfer to your device through

      purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our
      Services, support the security and performance of the Services, or allow

      activities of users, help us manage content and compile usage statistics.
      We may also use these in HTML e-mails we send, to help us track e-mail
      response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether
      our e-mails are forwarded.
    </p>

    <h3>Third-Party Analytics and Tools.</h3>
    <p>
      We use third party tools, such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Meta

      Services, and enhance performance and user experiences. These services

    <h3>Advertising, Personalized Content and Reporting.</h3>
    <p>
      We may work with third parties, such as ad networks, channel partners,
      analytics and measurement services and others to personalize content,
      messages and ads within our Services and/or on third party sites such as
      Facebook and similar companies. We may share personal information with
